                          in that directory. User can also specify an alternative 
                          location using transaction-service.txlog-file attribute. 
                          The transaction service creates and uses 3 files for 
                          logging and tracking transactions in progress. 

     heuristic-decision   During recovery, if outcome of a transaction cannot be 
                          determined from the logs, then this property is used 
                          to fix the outcome.

    retry-timeout-in-seconds used to determine the retry time in the following 
                             scenarios.  
                             1. Time to wait at the transaction recovery time, 
                                when resources are unreachable.
                             2. If there are any transient exceptions in the 
                                second phase of the 2 PC protocol.
                             A negative value indicates infinite retry.  
                             '0' indicates no retry.
                             A positive value indicates the number of seconds for 
                             which retry will be attempted. Default is 10 minutes 
                             which may be appropriate for a database being restarted.

     keypoint-interval    property used to specify the number of transactions between 
                          keypoint operations on the log.  A Keypoint operations could 
                          reduce the size of the transaction log files.  A larger value 
                          for this property (for example, 1000) will result in larger 
                          transaction log files, between log compactions, but less 
                          keypoint operations, and potentially better performance.
